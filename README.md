## To do
* Make custom dark mode message boxes
* Change the incoherent variable names
* Add file association
* More customization

## Changelog
Made it so that you can open files and have them open in the program.
Currently it only works if you drag a file over the program and it doesn't add itself to the "How do you want to open this app" list.
Also included the built exe under "build".
